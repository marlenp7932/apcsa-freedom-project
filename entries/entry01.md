# Entry 1 - What my project will be
### 11.10.2022
#### Revisitng last year <br>
For last years freedom project, my goal was to make an app like book organizer, which worked with spreadsheets. I realied after tinkering with other tools and considering other ideas that I was still very passionate and still determined to make this book organizer. While last year I did make an akost base of what I want it to be, I was still not satisified with the final product. My disastisfaction has lead me to make the decision that for this years project I will be working on the book organizer app once again. <br>
As of now, the app can only work for one person (me, the admin), and can only edit (adding books only, but can add to diffrent sheets) an existing spreadsheet. For this year, I have some goals on expanding this idea: <br>
* I want to keep the original idea of separating titles among different lists, and keep the spreadsheet layout 
* I plan on adding new editing features, the ability to not only add, but to remove and to edit existing information cells
* I want to make it more user friendly, so it is not just locked and limited to me <br>
More specifically, I want to be able to remove the connection to **only** Google Spreadhseets and Google Accounts, which meant I was changing my tool for this expansion of the app. <br>
#### My tool for this project <br>
For my project, I decided to work with Swift. I want to be able to turn this book organizer into a computer application (expanding how many users there are / can be), and I chodr Swift specifically because it is an easier language for app coding development, and has been used to develop applications like Lyft and Slack (Of course those used additional programs and advanced skills, but they possibly used Swift as a base). I also chose Swift because it works with the MacOS system, and for me I use majorly Apple products, so for me getting access to Swift and using it to create my app is very good. <br>
##### Why Google App Scripts doesn't work here <br>
Last year I did have a web app interface that can be recreated in Swift, but could have easily been continued in Google App Scripts. However, for me I find that Google App Scripts is a bit limiting in the way that it works with Google Spreadsheets only. While last year that was useful to get a feel for how I can organize information, now I find it limiting and wish to expand the functionality of the organizer beyond the spreadsheet. <br>
#### Where I am / skills <br>
As of right now, I find myself in step three of the **E**ngineering **D**esign **P**rocess, since I did steps one and two last year. Because I am working with a new tool, I need to brainstorm possible ways to go about creating this app. This involves first teaching myself how the tool works more in depth, and maybe even creating first versions of what I could want my app to look like. <br>
In regards to skills, during the first researching phase, and making choices stage of the freedom project, I found myself practicing the skills of *How to Read*, ***Debugging***,
