#### Ideas for how I'll learn <br>
In the last blog, I had briefly mentioned how I was going to watch a few videos as well as review the documentation. Although that was a more general idea. I had the project created, as well as the connection between Github and Xcode already. However, I found myself, even after reviewing forums and looking briefly into some videos, I didn't have much of an idea of where to start on Xcode. To further my learning, I had to focus on one of the main methods I learned, which was visually. I researched on resources like Youtube for any helpful guides to get me started coding on Swift itself, and found a youtube series that I thought would be helpful if I coded along with the videos. This way the skills I was learning would also stick with me. <br>

#### Coding videos + Coding along with them <br>
The [series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1Y5Cluhf7pKRNZtKaA3Q4kg) I found on Youtube allowed me to get started on Xcode, and fully familairize myself with the library and how to form and also test code through experiencing it myself. <br>

##### What I made / learnt from the first video <br>
In the first video, one of the things that I initially did was erase the original code that comes when you start a new project, and in a way recreate it from scratch to be able to learn the pieces of the Xcode library. As I watched the video, I found most helpful to take notes on a piece of paper of what was being told, except in a way I could understand. Then, as a way of review, I transfereed these notes into my digital notes. After this, I would usallay play the code along portions of the video lessons and work along with them so that I could get a hand on exprience coding on Xcode.
