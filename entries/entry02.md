#### Ideas for how I'll learn <br>
In the last blog, I had briefly mentioned how I was going to watch a few videos as well as review the documentation. Although that was a more general idea. I had the project created, as well as the connection between Github and Xcode already. However, I found myself, even after reviewing forums and looking briefly into some videos, I didn't have much of an idea of where to start on Xcode. To further my learning, I had to focus on one of the main methods I learned, which was visually. I researched on resources like Youtube for any helpful guides to get me started coding on Swift itself, and found a youtube series that I thought would be helpful if I coded along with the videos. This way the skills I was learning would also stick with me. <br>

#### Coding videos + Coding along with them <br>
The [series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1Y5Cluhf7pKRNZtKaA3Q4kg) I found on Youtube allowed me to get started on Xcode, and fully familairize myself with the library and how to form and also test code through experiencing it myself. <br>

##### What I made / learnt from the first video <br>
For each of the lessons in this mini series, I often watched each video twice. Once for general notes and getting what I was learning in my head, the second time usually to review any parts I didn't understand, as well as try out the code skills I learnt for myslf. As I watched the video, I found most helpful to take notes on a piece of paper of what was being told, except in a way I could understand. Then, as a way of review, I transfereed these notes into my digital notes. After the first watch of the video, this is often what I was left with:

Then for the second watch, I would usallay play the code along portions of the video lessons and work along with them so that I could get a hand on exprience coding on Xcode. For example, the point of the first video was introducing the library, which a lot the code elements (such as stacks, font elements etc) I'll be using for my project will be in. In creating a sample app with these elements, I not only learned how to work with the library that comes in Xcode, I learnt how to create parts of my own future project (e.g, I would need having multiple stack eleemtns in order to organize the different portions, such as text boxes, images, and buttons, properly on the screen).
