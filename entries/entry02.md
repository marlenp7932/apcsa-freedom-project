#### Ideas for how I'll learn <br>
In the last blog, I had briefly mentioned how I was going to watch a few videos as well as review the documentation. Although that was a more general idea. I had the project created, as well as the connection between Github and Xcode already. However, I found myself, even after reviewing forums and looking briefly into some videos, I didn't have much of an idea of where to start on Xcode. To further my learning, I had to focus on one of the main methods I learned, which was visually. I researched on resources like Youtube for any helpful guides to get me started coding on Swift itself, and found a youtube series that I thought would be helpful if I coded along with the videos. This way the skills I was learning would also stick with me. <br>
