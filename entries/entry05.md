# Entry 5 - Setback and final project

#### A big bug <br>
A major update from my project was once I had created the separate pages, I needed to look into how to *pass data between screens*. Since my own knowledge of this didn't have any idea on how to do this, I began researching videos and tutorials. A difficult part of this was that a lot of videos were very old and were using methods from different versions of XCode, which made it very difficult for me to follow along. After enough searching, I decided to watch one tutorial video in order to learn from it and try to implement certain methods into my code. However, once I finished I came across a bug that did not allow for the app to work, or even be tested. The difference with this error compared to other errors I had was this one was in the framework that came with the project and allowed Xcode to even run in the first place. Because of this, and after days of trying to debug and work through the code, I realized I would have to restart my project from scratch in a new file. <br>
#### Having to restart <br>
With restarting, I also took the opportunity to set up the proper file. One of my major problems when researching help videos for transferring data between viewcontrollers was that they were using different methods that were not available to me because, when I initially started my file, I made it multiplatform. A lot of the data transfer for Xcode is done with *mobile* only. Although I recognize that there are methods to be able to implement data transfer for multi platform applications, the resources and time I needed to be able to find this was not available. I created a new file for my project and switched to a mobile application framework only so that I can implement the focal point of my projects function. <br>
#### Storyboarding <br>
One of the keys to being able to transfer data between screens, which I needed for my project to function, is **storyboarding**. <br>

As seen above in storyboarding, I can more easily design each screen for my project. Then, using segues, I can connect each separate screen together and tell the computer to move to the screen it is pointing to depending on the action. For my project, the setting I put was *when this button is clicked, move (show) the next screen*. That command is what the segue is controlling. With this method, I was more able to connect each screen and be able to move data more fluidly through the code. <br>
