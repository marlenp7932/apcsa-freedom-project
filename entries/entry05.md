# Entry 5 - Setback and final project
##### 04/17/23

#### A big bug <br>
A major update from my project was once I had created the separate pages, I needed to look into how to *pass data between screens*. Since my own knowledge of this didn't have any idea on how to do this, I began researching videos and tutorials. A difficult part of this was that a lot of videos were very old and were using methods from different versions of XCode, which made it very difficult for me to follow along. After enough searching, I decided to watch one tutorial video in order to learn from it and try to implement certain methods into my code. However, once I finished I came across a bug that did not allow for the app to work, or even be tested. The difference with this error compared to other errors I had was this one was in the framework that came with the project and allowed Xcode to even run in the first place. Because of this, and after days of trying to debug and work through the code, I realized I would have to restart my project from scratch in a new file. <br>
