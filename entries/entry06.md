##### 04/17/23

#### Preparing for the Expo <br>
When preparing for the expo, I had first started to look over what the most important parts of my project are, and from their I took pieces and details of these importnat things and noted them down. I had also noted down what improvements I wanted to make and goals in the futrue I had in case I would need to answer questions and explain my journey so that everyone who saw my project would understand what I am doing. In my elevator pitch, I made sure to talk about the most important takeways and ideas I got from my time of working on my project, the pitch you can see in the following notes. This year, I didnt really focus on taking notes in a document and aytime i had to take notes, I would take them down on a piece of paper as it made it easier for me to understand.
