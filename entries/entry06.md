# Entry 6 - Expo and presentation
##### 04/17/23

#### Preparing for the Expo <br>
When preparing for the expo, I had first started to look over what the most important parts of my project are, and from there I took pieces and details of these important things and noted them down. I had also noted down what improvements I wanted to make and goals in the future I had in case I would need to answer questions and explain my journey so that everyone who saw my project would understand what I am doing. In my elevator pitch, I made sure to talk about the most important takeaways and ideas I got from my time of working on my project, the pitch you can see in the following [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxfTsm58L4cC5AzZkxz5yUiHB6wz8GvOv6CUxXROj9Y/edit). This year, I didn't really focus on taking notes in a document and anytime I had to take notes, I would take them down on a piece of paper as it made it easier for me to understand. <br>
#### Expo Takeaways <br>
Some of my takeaways from the expo are that I think it went well. I felt as though I was able to explain my project clearly, even though there was not much there to explain in the first place. Something I wish I had done differently is prepare more for talking to judges. Although I prepared for most questions that could possibly come up, there were a few times where i didnt know what to say because rather than it being prepared questions or presenting the functions of my project, it was basic small talk that I had to do, and I really struggled with that. i think my preparation was helpful but lead to my work being too scripted, which for the expo made me seem much more nervous. <br>
