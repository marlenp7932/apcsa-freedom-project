# Entry 3 - Starting my project
## (And continuing my tool)

#### How far I have learned my tool <br>
In the last blog, I talked about the [video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1Y5Cluhf7pKRNZtKaA3Q4kg) I planned on watching to really get myself started on. By now, I feel much more comfortable working with Swift UI, however not 100%. Even then, I now am starting to work on planning out my final MVP product. Allowing myself to take the time to map out my overall product also gives me more time to review a bit of what I learned so my execution can be quick and simple.
#### Putting a plan into action <br>
Since I now know how to work with Swift, I shifted my focus over to what I will be creating since I realized I didn't really know all the components that I wanted to be included in my final product. So I started thinking about what my MVP will look like as well as what parts it will have. Writing this down, I realized I needed to split up the work so I can also be efficient with my time. This lead to the creation of this [MVP plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aWjIdviVXkR4k31HKN_4qVQc7dfO9_cn24f55OzP0o/edit). I will be using this plan to guide me on my process, which I already did as one of the first steps..
#### The big picture
I wanted to map out exactly what my project would look like all on one screen. I knew I wanted: 
* A total of 4 functions with each their own separate app page / menu
* A main menu where you can access either of these pages on <br>

The more specific functions of how they work on will be worked on later as that is mostly the bulk of the project, but I first wanted to know what I will be working towards specifically on the front end (basically my idea was work on visualize front end, work on back end, finalize front end). Using another resource, I then mapped out each of the pages and how exactly they would look like, ending up with something like this:
In the diagram I basically made a main menu that the user will open up to on the screen. Then in the middle there will be four buttons, the user can click on either of those depending on what they want to do, and the button will take the user to the designated page. From there the user can do what they need to and on the bottom I am hoping to find a way so that the user can go back to the main menu easily. 
#### Next steps <br>
My next steps now that I know what I am aiming to make is to actually begin the project. I wanted to get a few more tests in, but I mostly want to focus on looking for the methods and code snippets and ideas I will be using for my project and test them out. My main coding goal especially is to ensure that everything I want to make, all the pages and functions are able to work together cohesively to make a well functioning MVP.
#### Where I am / skills <br>
In the **E**ngineering **D**esign **P**rocess, I find myself now in Step 4 of planning the most promising solution. I am mapping out what the best solution is for what my project could look like since one of the most important things in an app is how the user will be using it. Mapping it out allows me to make the app user friendly so that the rest of the functions could work well. If the app back end works well, but the user can not even use it, then there is no point. <br>
As for skills, I found myself really only using the skills of *attention to detail* and *consideration*. 
* For *attention to detail* while mapping out my plan, I had to make sure to get the small details of the functions for my app. One example being the return button. Once a user clicks into a menu, I realized there would need to be a small detail of adding some sort of way to get back to the main menu, especially if a user were to want to do something else. 
* Going hand in hand with the other skill, I especially practiced the skill of *consideration* in this part. Since I want to make sure my app is the most user friendly, while planning the layout and small buttons and functions of my app, I was really considering how it would be used by others. I made a list in my head of all possible issues that could appear with others using it and tried a lot to address them so that these issues would not appear at all. In the end both these skills allowed me to plan out my application the best way I could and set me up to code my app in a prepared way.
