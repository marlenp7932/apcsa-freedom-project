# Book Nook
by Marlen Penafort

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about creating an application or running program based on someones interests. The purpose of this blog is to describe my journey in creating this app, through my lenses and seeing how I understood and struggled to create a final functioning project.

## Content
For my project, I am making an interactive book application meant for IOS mobile devices that is able to allow the user to organize books in their phone. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Swift and XCode in order to make the book application dubbed Book Nook.

## Implications
Socially, this app allows readers to be more organized on their reading journey, which by itself may be intimidating enough. Being able to be organized and not stress about an overwhelming amount of books can reduce the stress of wanting to read and may even encourage people to read as everyone loves to see a list full with check marks signifying completion. Globally, as mentioned before, motivation to read allows all kinds of people to read, such as students. Students reading at an early age allows their education to be further enriched, improving the education system as a whole.
